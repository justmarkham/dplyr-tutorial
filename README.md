## Introduction to dplyr for Faster Data Manipulation in R

I created a [40-minute video tutorial](http://youtu.be/jWjqLW-u3hc) introducing Hadley Wickham's excellent [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr) package, and posted the walk-through document used in the video [on RPubs](http://rpubs.com/justmarkham/dplyr-tutorial).

Numerous people asked me for a copy of the source document to adapt for their own purposes, and I'm happy to oblige! [View the R Markdown document here](dplyr-tutorial.Rmd), and then click [Raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justmarkham/dplyr-tutorial/master/dplyr-tutorial.Rmd) to view a plain-text version that you can easily save. (Or, just clone this repository!)

More information about the tutorial is available on [my blog](http://www.dataschool.io/dplyr-tutorial-for-faster-data-manipulation-in-r/).
